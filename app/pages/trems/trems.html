We also reserve the right at our discretion to restrict a user's usage of Koodka either temporarily or permanently, or refuse a user's registration.

Abusing Koodka

Koodka and the Koodka community work together to keep the Koodka websites, services, applications and tools working properly and the community safe. Please report problems, offensive content and policy breaches to us using the reporting system.

Without limiting other remedies, we may issue warnings, limit or terminate our service, remove hosted content and take technical and legal steps to keep users off Koodka if we think that they are creating problems, infringing the rights of third parties or acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of our policies (including, without limitation, circumventing temporary or permanent suspensions or harassing the Koodka employees or other users). However, whether we decide to take any of these steps, remove hosted content or keep a user off Koodka or not, we do not have any obligation to monitor the information transmitted or stored on our sites, services, applications and tools and we do not accept any liability for unauthorized or unlawful content on Koodka or use of Koodka by users.

Global Marketplace

Some of Koodka's features may display your ad on other sites, services, applications and tools that are part of the global community, such as Facebook, Twitter or our classifieds sites in other countries. By using Koodka, you agree that your ads can be displayed on these other sites, services, applications and tools. The terms for our other sites, services, applications and tools are similar to these terms, but you may be subject to additional laws or other restrictions in the countries, regions and states where your ad is posted. When you choose to post your ad on another site, service, application or tool, you may be responsible for ensuring that it does not violate such other site, service, application and tool policies. We may remove your ad if it is reported on any our sites, services, applications or tools, or if we believe it causes problems or violates any law or policy.


Fees and Services

Using Koodka is generally free, but we sometimes charge a fee for certain services. If the service you use incurs a fee, you'll be able to review and accept terms that will be clearly disclosed at the time you post your ad. Our fees are quoted in Dollars, Somali and Somaliland Shillings, and we may change them from time to time. We'll notify you of changes to our fee policy by posting such changes on the Koodka website. We may choose to temporarily change our fees for promotional events or new services; these changes are effective when we announce the promotional event or new service.


You are responsible for paying the Koodka fees when they're due. If you don't, without prejudice to any other right or remedy we may be entitled to under these Terms of Use or by law, we may limit your ability to use the services. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms.


You acknowledge that your ads may be deleted from the Koodka sites, services, applications or tools in case we believe these Terms of Use, including our Posting Rules, are breached, either directly or indirectly. In case you would have paid a fee for the display of such ad, you may be entitled to a refund of such fee. However, we reserve the right not to refund the Koodka users for any fees paid through use of our sites, services, applications and tools in the following cases:

•	If you breach, in our opinion, these Terms of Use, which include, without limitation, the Posting Rules;

•	If your ads went live with exposure on the Koodka sites, services, applications or tools, even for a limited time, and that they benefited from the service associated with the paid fee;

•	If your ads are placed in the Massage categories of Koodka;

•	If your ads are placed into "edit" mode and will go live to site once updated by you;

•	If you have removed your ads yourself;

•	If you post duplicate ads as defined in our rules regarding duplicate ads;

In addition, you waive all moral rights you have in the content to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Infringement

Do not post content that infringes the rights of third parties. This includes, but is not limited to, content that infringes on intellectual property rights such as copyright, design and trademark (e.g. offering counterfeit items for sale). A large number of products of all sorts are offered on Koodka.com by private individuals from the Somali-Peninsula and beyond. Entitled parties, in particular owners of copyright, trademark rights or other rights can report any advertisement which may infringe on their rights, and submit a request for such advertisement to be removed. If a legal representative of the entitled party reports this to us in the correct manner, products infringing on the intellectual property rights will be removed by Koodka.

Reporting an infringement:

In order to participate in the Notice of Infringement Programme, you only need to complete a Notice of Infringement Form and email it to Koodka at contact@koodka.com complete with your signature, to report advertisements, which may infringe on your property rights. The information requested in the Notice of Infringement Form is for the purpose of ensuring that the parties reporting these objects are either the entitled party or their officially authorized representative. This information must also enable Koodka to identify the advertisement to be removed. Once we have received your correctly completed Notice of Infringement Form, you can simply send later reports to Koodka via the e-mail address provided.

Note: This form can only be used by the lawful owners of the relevant intellectual property rights. The "Notice of Infringement" is intended to enable rights owners to ensure that products offered by Koodka users do not infringe their copyright, trademark rights or other intellectual property rights. For all other questions, visitors and advertisers can get help contacting Koodka at contact@koodka.com

In no event do we accept liability of any description for the posting of any unlawful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, obscene or indecent information, or material of any kind which violates or infringes upon the rights of any other person, including without limitation any transmissions constituting or encouraging conduct that would constitute a criminal offence, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any applicable law.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you. Despite the previous paragraph, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or any third party (whether in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability in tort, by statute or otherwise) is limited to the greater of (a) the total fees you pay to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to liability, and (b) $50 USD.
